	Long: `The 'delete' command allows you to delete a specific backup configuration from the OPNsense system. It is limited to /conf/backup directory only.

Examples:
  opnsense delete filename.xml  - Delete a specific file in /conf/backup.
  opnsense delete age 10        - Delete all files older than 10 days
  opnsense delete trim 10       - Delete the oldest 10 backup files
  opnsense delete keep 10       - Delete all backup files except the most recent 10
