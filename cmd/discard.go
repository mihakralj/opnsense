	Use:   "discard [<xpath>]",
	Short: "Discards changes in the staging.xml file.",
	Long: `The 'discard' command discard changes staged in the staging.xml file. You can discard changes for a specific node identified
by an XPath or discard all changes if no XPath is provided.

Using an XPath allows targeting specific nodes in staging.xml without affecting other modifications that are staged for commit.
If no XPath is specified, all changes in the staging.xml file will be discarded, removing any staged changes to the config.xml.

Examples:
  opnsense discard interfaces/wan/if   - discards changes made to the 'if' node under 'wan' interface
  opnsense discard system/hostname     - discards changes made to the 'hostname' node
  opnsense discard                     - discards all changes in the staging.xml file.

To review staged changes, use 'opnsense show config' or 'opnsense compare' (without arguments).
Always use discard command with caution to avoid losing uncommitted work.`,
